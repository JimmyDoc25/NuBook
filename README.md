# Project FullProof

## Overview
Welcome to **Project FullProof**! This project aims to create a modern, free, and comprehensive library of rigorous mathematical proofs. Our mission is to make high-quality, well-documented mathematical resources accessible to students, educators, researchers, and enthusiasts worldwide.

## Objectives
- **Centralized Resource**: Build an open-source repository of mathematical proofs covering various fields, including algebra, calculus, geometry, number theory, and more.
- **Clarity and Rigor**: Ensure all proofs are clear, precise, and adhere to rigorous mathematical standards.
- **Accessibility**: Provide content that caters to different levels of expertise, from beginners to advanced mathematicians.
- **Community-Driven**: Encourage contributions from the global mathematical community to expand and refine the library.

## Getting Started
Project FullProof is hosted on [GitHub](#) (replace with actual repository link). To explore the library:
- Browse the proof categories to find topics of interest.
- Download or view proofs in markdown or PDF format.
- Contribute by submitting new proofs or improving existing ones (see [Contributing](#contributing)).

## Proof Categories
The library is organized into the following mathematical fields (to be expanded):
- **Algebra**: Proofs related to groups, rings, fields, and linear algebra.
- **Calculus**: Proofs of theorems in limits, derivatives, integrals, and series.
- **Geometry**: Proofs in Euclidean, non-Euclidean, and differential geometry.
- **Number Theory**: Proofs involving primes, divisibility, and Diophantine equations.
- **Topology**: Proofs related to topological spaces and continuity.
- **Analysis**: Proofs in real and complex analysis.

Each proof includes:
- A clear statement of the theorem.
- A step-by-step proof with explanations.
- References to related concepts or prerequisite knowledge.

## Contributing
We welcome contributions from the community! To contribute:
